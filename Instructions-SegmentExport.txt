This file explains how to use the Export Segmentation Imaris XT exenstion.
The extension has been written in Python. 

First of all it is necessary to interface Python with Imaris.
To this purpouse follow the instructions listed in the internal url "XInterface" (Doxygen documentation)
that can be found by opening the Imaris program -> Help -> Programming Interface

Go to the Connect Imaris in Python tab and follow the instructions. 

If you then would like to use this extension from the Imaris GUI, make sure that the path to the extension is added to the paths of XTension folders: 
Imaris -> File -> Preferences -> Custom Tools and add the path to XTension Folders.

From the Imaris interface, select the view on your desired segmented cells (be aware that everything will be exported, not only the visible ones under the "Label" option.
The script will overload the Volume scene with a mask assigning to each pixel a color corrisponding to the segmentation. 

Now the segmentation is ready to be saved as a Tiff Series (File ->Save As -> Adjustable Tiff Series)
