This file explains how to use the Export Segmentation Imaris XT exenstion.
The extension has been written in Python. 

First of all it is necessary to interface Python with Imaris.
To this purpouse follow the instructions listed in the internal url "xinterface" (Doxygen documentation)
that can be found by opening the Imaris program -> Help -> Programming Interface

Go to the Connect Imaris in Python tab and follow the instructions. 

Place the extension within the XT/python folder in Imaris es. C:\Program Files\Bitplane\Imaris x64 9.2.0\XT\python
If you do not have admin rights, you won't be able to perform this operation and will need to execute the extension
 from a python terminal or change the path in the extension preamble.

From the Imaris interface, select the view on your desired cells (be aware that everything will be exported, not only the visible ones under the by "Label" option.
The script will overload the Volume scene with a mask assigning to each pixel a color corrisponding to the segmentation. 
To be sure to export this in a visible format (also for the human eye), change the Channel properties (Edit ->Image Properties -> Channels ->Channel 1).
 Go to Mapped Color and assign the Random heatmap (Mapped Color ->Color Table File -> Random). This way the segmented volumes will have human-eye recognizable different colors.
Also check that the range of the Channel goes really from 0 to the Max value, otherwise change the range.

Now the segmentation is ready to be saved as a Tiff Series (File ->Save As -> Adjustable Tiff Series)
